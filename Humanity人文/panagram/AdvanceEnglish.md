# "The Middle Eastern Bazaar"

　　The Middle Eastern bazaar takes you back hundreds-even thousands-of years. The one I am thinking of particularly is entered by a Gothic-arched gateway of aged brick and stone. You pass from the heat and glare of a big, open square into a cool, dark cavern which extends as far as the eye can see, losing itself in the shadowy distance. Little donkeys with harmoniously tinkling bells thread their way among the throngs of people entering and leaving the bazaar. The road way is about 12 feet wide, but it is narrowed every few yards by little stalls where good of every conceivable kind are sold. The din of the stall-holders crying their wares of donkey-boys and porters clearing a way for themselves by shouting vigorously, and of would-be purchasers arguing and bargaining is continuous and makes you dizzy.

　　Then as you penetrate deeper into the bazaar, the noise of entrance fade away, and you come to the muted cloth market. The earthen floor, beaten hard by countless feet, deadens the sound of footsteps, and the vaulted mud-brick walls and roof have hardly and sounds to echo. The shopkeepers speak in slow, measured tones, and the buyers, *overwhelmed by the sepulchral atmosphere*, follow suit.

　　One of the peculiarities, of the Eastern bazaar is that shop-keepers dealing in the same kind of goods do not scatter themselves over the bazaar, in order to avoid competition, but collect in the save area, so that purchasers can know where to find them, and so that they can form a closely knit guild against injustice or persecution. In the cloth-market, for instance, all the sellers of material for clothes, curtains, chaircovers and so on line the roadway on both sides, each open-fronted shop having a trestle table for display and shelves for storage. Bargaining is the order of the day, and veiled women move at a leisurely pace from shop to shop, selecting, pricing and doing a little preliminary bargaining before they narrow down their choice and begin the really serious business of beating the price down. It is a point of honour with the customer not to let the shop keeper guess what it is she really likes and wants until the lat moment. If he does guess correctly, he will price the item high, and yield little in the bargaining. The seller, on the other hand, makes a point of protesting that the price he is charging is depriving him of all profit, and that he is sacrificing this because of his personal regard for the customer. Bargainning can go on the whole day, or even several days, with the customer coming and going at intervals.

　　One of the most picturesque and impressivie parts of the bazaar is the copper-smiths' market. As you approach it, a tinkling and banging and clashing begins to impinge on your ear. It grows louder and more distinct, until you round a corner and see a fairyland of dacing flashes, as the burnished copper catches the light of innumerable lamps and braziers. In each shop sit the apprentices-boys and youths, some of them incredibly yound- hammering away at copper vessels of all shapes and size, while the shop-owner in-background, a tiny apprentice blows a big charcoal fire with a huge leather bellows worked by a string attached to his big toe-the red of the live coals glowing bright and then dimming rhythmically to the strokes of the bellows.

　　Here you can find beautiful pots and bowls engraved with delicate and intricate traditional designs-some bold and rich colours, varied textures and reginal designs- some bold and simple, others unbelievably detailed and yet harmonious. Then there is the spice-market, with its pungent and exotic smells; and the food-market, where you can buyeverything you need for the most sumptuous dinner, or sit in a tiny restaurant with porters and apprentices and eat your humble bread and cheese. The dye-market, the pottery market and the carpenters' market lie elsewhere in the maze of vaulted streets which honeycomb this bazaar. every here and there ,a doorway gives a glimpse of a sunlit coutyard, perhaps before a mosque or a caravanserai, where camels lie disdainfully chewing their hay, while the great bales of mechandise they have carried hundreds of miles across the desert lie beside them.

　　Perhaps the most unforgettable thing in the bazaar, apart from its general atmosphere, is the place where they make linseed oil. It is a vast, sombre cavern of a room, some thirty feet high and sixty feet square, and so thick with the dust of centuries that the mudbrick walls and vaulted roof are only dimly visible. In this cavern are three massive stone wheels, each with a huge pole through its cntre as anb axle. The pole is attached at the one end to an upright post, around which it can revolve, and at the other to a blind-folded camel, which walks constantly in a circle, providing the motive power to turn the stone wheel. This revovles in a circular stone channel, into which an attendant feeds linseed. The stone wheel crushes it6 to a pulp, which is the npressed to extract the oil. The camels are the largest and finest I have ever seen, and in superb condition-muscular, massive and stately.

　　The pressing of linseed pulp to extract the oil is done by a vast ramshackle apparatus of beams and ropes and pulleys which towers to the vaulted ceiling and dwarfs the camels and their stone wheels. The machine is operated by one man who shovels the linseed pulp into a stone vat, climbs up nimbly to a dizzy height to fasten ropes, and then throws his weight on to a great beam made out of a tree trunk to set tighten and then a trickle of oil oozes down a stone runnel into a used petrol can. Quickly the trickle becomes a flood of glisteening linseed oil as the beam sinks earthwards, taut and protesting its creaks blending with the squeaking and rumbling of the grinding wheels and the occasional grunts and sighs of the camels.

# Hiroshima - the "Liveliest City in Japan" Jacques Danvoir "Hiroshima!

Everybody off!" That must be what the man in the Japanese                                                                 
stationmaster's uniform shouted, as the fastest train in the world
slipped to a stop in Hiroshima Station. I did not understand what he was
saying. First of all, because he was shouting in Japanese. And secondly,
because I had a lump in my throat and a lot of sad thoughts on my mind
that had little to do with anything a Nippon railways official might
say. The very act of stepping on this soil, in breating this air of
Hiroshima, was for me a far greater adventure than any trip or any
reportorial assignment I'd previously taken. Was I not at the scene of
the crime? The Japanese crowd did not appear to have the same
preoccupations that I had. From the sidewalk outside the station, things
seemed much the same as in other Japanese cities. Little girls and
elderly ladies in kimonos rubbed shoulders with teenagers and women in
western dress. Serious-looking men spoke to one another as if they were
oblivious of the crowds about them, and bobbed up and down repeatedly in
little bows, as they exchanged the ritual formula of gratitude and
respect: "Tomo aligato gozayimas." Others were using little red
telephones that hung on the facades of grocery stores and tobacco shops.
"Hi! Hi!" said the cab driver, whose door popped open at the very sight
of a traveler. "Hi", or something that sounds very much like it, means
"yes". "Can you take me to City Hall?" He grinned at me in the rear-view
mirror and repeated "Hi!","Hi!" We set off at top speed through the
narrow streets of Hiroshima. The tall buidings of the martyred city
flashed by as we lurched from side to side in response to the driver's
sharp twists of the wheel. Just as I was beginning to find the ride
long, the taxi screeched to a halt, and the driver got out and went over
to a policeman to ask the way. As in Tokyo, taxi drivers in Hiroshima
often know little of their city, but to avoid loss of face before
foreigners, will not admit their ignorance, and will accept any
destination without convern for how long it may take them to find it.

At last this intermezzo came to and end, and I found myself in front of
the gigantic City Hall. The usher bowed deeply and heaved along, almost
musical sigh, when I showed him the invitation which the mayor had sent
me in response to my request for and interview. "That is not here,sir."
he said in English. "The mayor expects you tonight for dinner with other
foregners on the restaurant boat. See? This is where it is." He sketched
a little map for me on the back of my invitation. Thanks to his map, I
was able to find a taxi driver who could take me straight to the canal
embankment, where a sort of barge with a roof like one on a Japanese
house was moored. The Japanese build their traditional houses on boats
when land becomes too expensive. The rather arressting spectable of
little old Japan adrift amid beige concreate skyscrapers is the very
symbol of the incessant  stuggle between the kmono and the miniskirt.
