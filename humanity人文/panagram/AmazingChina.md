# Amazing China
## 1. Perpetually White Mountains

Located the northeast of China the Changbai Mountains is named after its iconic scenery of being perpetually white almost all year long.
These mountains were formed around 2.77 million years ago after volcano eruptions due to the movement of the earth crust.
At the top of the main mountain there is a crater lake with an altitude of 2100meters.
It is called "Tian Chi" in Chinese, literally meaning Heaven Lake.
Its latest eruption happened acround 300 years ago.
Tianchi is the largest crater lake in China, and its is the deepest mountain lake around the world as well.
The average depth of water is 204 meters.
It has stored over 2 billion tons of freshwater, which is able to supply the population in Beijing downtown for 22months.
The winter lasts for 9 months in the Changbai Mountains.
Thus, the crest of the mountain is covered by snow most of the time. 
The depth of the snow is 50 centimeters on average.
it is extremely difficult to visit the mountain during the winter.
Lake Tianchi only melts in Mid-July due to the cold weather and the water in the lake is flowing for only 30 days every year.
It is always misty and cloudy.
According to the locals, people could only see the most imposing scenery here if they have a special mysterious connection with this 'magical mountain'.

## 2. Four Sisters await for Adventures

Mount Siguniang or Mount Four Sisters is located in southwestern China's Sichuan province.
The mountain gets its name from its four peaks adjacent to each other.
Local legend says that the mountain god's four beautiful daughters defeated the 
devil and turned into four snow mountains to guard the local people. 
The snowy mountains offer one of the toughest challenges for those who would like conquer them.
Out of the four sisters, the youngest one- the youmei peak is the highest and steepest of them all, with the altitude of 6250 meters.
Only the bravest climbers around the world dare to take the challenge.
There are glaciers hanging on the southern slope and extending to the foot of the mountain.
The western and the northern slope are formed by the daunting steep rocks. 
So far, the summit record for the Yaomei Peak is only 11 times.
The Japanese and the American made it twice each. 
The British, the French and Russian teams made it once each, and Chinese team reached the top for four times.
Besides the four remarkable peaks, Mount Siguniang also has lots of other mountain and valleys that are ready for exploration. 
The 5484-meters high Camel Peak is formed by two connected peaks.
Between them there is a glacier plain.
But  right behind these glaciers, its is a vertical cliff.
And wer have the pomiu Peak that looks like a pyramid Five Colours Mountain with an altitude of 5500 meters, and the Hunter Mountain with an altitude of 5182 meters.
Thanks for its breath-taking and wide landscape, Mount Sioguniang is also known as "The Oriental Alps".
For the bravest adventures worldwide, the Four Sisters will continue to lure them and wait for the next one to stand on top of them.

## 3. Lakes with Amazing Colours

Hidden deep in the mountains of western China's Sichuan province, there is a primitive and dreamy valley called Jiuzhaigou.
It has preserved one of the most stunning view of nature that it could be called China's  Garden of Eden.
Its signature landscape is the crystal lakes with turquoise and many other colours of white, blue green, or emerald.
The secret of colouring the lake is the spyrogyra, charophyte, and other kinds of ferns that grow in the water.
They contain chlorophyll, which helps create various colors.
These colors vary according to the season, light and the viewing angle.
There are 108 lakes like this dotted aro8und the three major valleys in Jiuzhaigou.
Each of these valleys has an altitude higher than 2000 meters and altogether the valleys are 49 kilometers long.
Besides these magical lakes, Jiuzhaigo also has China's widest waterfall Nuorilang Waterfall, with a width of 270 meters.
If you visit Jiuzhaigou during the right time, you may even experience the rotaion of four seasons in one day.
From the colourful scene to the white apperance, Jiuzhaigou could od it in very short time.
It is perhaps the ultimate fairyland in China.

4. A Land Formed by the Blowing Dust- Loess Plateau

The Earth is a place of endless wonder where landscapes are often created from mere dust.
The Loess Platueau is such a place.
It is located in the north of central China, and contains 70% of the loess on the planet.
It is hard to imagine a time when it dis not exist. 
But this yellow land was created by particles carried by the wind.
The entire mega landscape has a total area of 620,000 square kilometers.
Even seen from above, it's had to comprehend the sheer size of it.
The loess dune is doezens of meters high, and 300 metres at its thickest.
Eight million years ago, super strong winds blew sand and dust here.
The entire process of dust carrying and stacking took more than 2.6 million year. 
Scientists can tell the wind direction by the thickness of the loess.
Because tiny dust particles are carried the furthest, they came to test in the southeastern most part of the plateau.
The sand in the northwest part of the plateau is much r4ougher.
Where the river crossed, and alluvial plain was deposited.
People gradually started to settle around these fertile areas.
They farmed in the valley, and built roads btween the ravines.
Finally, they made this ancient land their home and prospered generation after generation.

5. A Mysterious Place in the South China Sea

Starting from Hainan Island, the southernmost province of China, you can reach Sansha City at the southern tip, by this transportation supply ship.
Sansha is made is made up of more than 280 islands, sandbars, reefs and other sea areas.
April to May are the most beautiful seasons in this part of China.
The sea is colorful, with an average visiblity of more than 30 meters.
Looking down from a high altitude, the islands in front of us do not seem to be connected with each other , but they are known as the Seven Connected Islets.
That's because beneath the sea, there is a huge reef holding them together, forming a common foundation for the little islands.
As the tide rises-and falls, they display a variety of features.
Most of the islets here are made up of coral remains.
Coral secretes limestone, which becomes their living shells.
They gather together and grow and multiply from generation to generation.
Layer upon layer of limstone is added and then compacted to form the coral reef we see today.
This reef is still growing, towards the sea, at a rate of about 2.5 centimeters per year.

6. Holy Mountain

Daocheng Yading is a magical and mysterious land located in the southwest of China Sichuan province.
This is a kingdom surrounded by breath-taking views of snow-capped mountains, steep glaciers, crystal clear lakes, vast pastures, as well as dense woods.
Its is called the last pure land on this blue planet.
Every September, the scenery here is at its most fascinatinng.
It's like placing people einto a colorful fairy tale world.
The focal pont is the three mountain peaks in Daocheng Yading.
The most beautiful is called Yang Maiyong.
Its is about 6,000 meters in height, and has the shape of a perfect pyramid.
Back in 1931, the American explorer Joseph Rock first introduced it to the world with photos taken for the National Geographic magazine.
He wrote, "she is the most beautiful snow peak my eyes have ever seen". 
Next to it, stand two other mountains: Xianairi and Xianuoduoji.
The crest of the mountains is coverd by snow most of the time.
No one has yet ever been able to reach the top.
They are called the "Three Holy Maintains".
Its is an irrepalceably sacred place in the hearts of the local people.
the locals say that if one could walk round the holy mountains three times, then your wished for this life will be fulfilled.
But it is such a great challenge to both one's physical ability and mind, because of its altitude. What drives them to do that?
Perhaps it is simple faith.
It is not only the last pure land, but also earth that can purify the soul.

7. Scarlet rocks Under Glaciers

There is a rare spectable to be found at the end of the glaciers beneath the main peak of a mountain area in southwestern China.
The surface of the rocks here is an eye catching bright red.
This is the heart of the Hengduan Mountains, a mountainous region in southwestern China.
145 snowy peaks over 5,000 meters above sea level are clustered here, forming and amazing group of mountains.
The highest peak, Gongga Mountain, is 7,556 meters above sea level.
It is the highest point in the mountainous area of Southwest China.
Its giant conical peak is cradle of glacier formation, from which 74 mature glacers extend in all directions.
The Hailuogou Glacier in the east has a huge icy waterfall measuring 1,100 meters wide, with a drop of more and 1,000 meters.
The strong thawing effect leads to frequent massive icy avalanches.
Gian glacers descend all the way into dense forests.
With its tip extending to 2,850 meters above sea level, it is the lowest maritime glacers in Asia.
Bright red rocks can be seen almost everywhere  in the valley at the end of the glacers.
Scientists have found that the red blood color on the stone is not from a mineral, but a rare parasite, a rare lichen complex.
Whenever the temperature and humidity are right, they spread across the rock surface dyeing the rocks bright red.
Taken away from the mountains however, they quickly change color and die.
Even if they are left in peace their life span is only four to five years, and then they will regenerate an begain coloring the rocks bright red again.
Whye they came into being has baffled many great minds.

8. The Tectonic Story of Sanpan Stone

In China's southeast coastal province of Zhejiang, there is a group of giant rocks called the Sanpan Stone, literally meaning, the three pieces of stone.
Once upon a time however they were one whole piece of rock. 
The story of the Sanpan Stone started 135 million years ago.
Back then, during a violent tectonic event, powerful forces formed a basin covering nearly 347 square miles.
Imagine the basin as a cradle, in which the Sanpan Stone is nestling.
In this huge bowl, sedimentary rocks gathered, dominated by conglomerates.
These sediments were the origins of the Sanpan Stone.
The process of mountain building continued. 
The sediments in the basin were forced up to form a sedimentary massif, which gradually grew into the Sanpan Stone.
For tens of millins of year, Wind and water eroded the massif along  vertical fractures until most of the rock was  weathered away.
Eventually the three inddividual rocks with steep cliffs we see today were formed.
The highest of them measures 324 metres.
However, the steep cliffs pose a great challnge for those wishing to reach the top.
About 500 years ago, in China's Ming Dynasty, a group of carpenters was hired to build a wooden ladder in order to reach the top the Sanpan stone.
They toiled for three long years, but failed in their task.
Before the ladder could reach the summit, its foot had rotted away.
The ambition of reaching the top was not achieved until the end of 1980s.
Over 3,500 stone steps were carved into the rock face.
Now, we can finally climb these steep stairs and reach the top, to experience the power of the tectonic movements from the remoste past.

9. Huge Bonsai between Water and Sky

Wuyi Mountain, located in the southeastern part of China, has a total area of about 1,000 square kilometers.
It has the largest nature reserve in Fujian Province, and the largest existing subtropical primary forest system in the same latitude zone in the world.
Wuyi Mountain is deeply influenced by a fault zone, which controls the direction of the ridge line.
The other faults divide the mountain tinto several fault blocks and form many deep valleys.
The Tongmuguan Fualt Zone is the center of the faults, forming a spectacular "V" shaped grand canyon.
The instense tectoic movements of millions of years ago gifted Wuyi Montain a magnificent Danxia landform, which differs from the Danxia landform in Northwest Chian.
Many of the rock surfaces are covered with different shades of vegetation, creating a blush on the huge green mountain.
The Goddess Peak, the symbo of Wuyi Mountain, is the typicaal residual {Danxia landform left byt faults.
Geological movement caused a red-rock massif to collapse under its enormous weight.
The Goddess Peak is thelast remaining pillar of the surrounding rocks after the collapse.
The are many cracks in the karst rocks of Wuyi Mountain.
After millions of years of scouring and cutting by wate4r flowing through them, many streams have been formed around the mountain.
Sitting on bamboo rafts and following the stream, tourists can enjoy the seenery of Wuyi Mountain along the way.


10. The Rainbow Hills of China

In Norhwestern china, there is a chain of undulating hills called Colorful Zhangye Danxia.
Here you can find the colors of the rainbow.
The terrian is so hostile that even grass struggles to survive.
So where did this palette of colors come from?
It's hard to imagine, but this area was once a lake.
the multi-colored hills are theresult of the long geological evolution of the lakebed.
Changes in temperature and humidity, as well as the existence of various mineral elements, and the differing iron content in lake seiments especially, gave rise to the spectrum of colors.
Part of the ancient Silk Road, it is said that Marco Polo once visited hereover 700 years ago.
However, compared to Marco Polo, today we can have much more fun.

11. West Lake

There are no less than 30 lakes name "West Lake" in China.
But the West Lake in Hangzhou is the best known of them all.
It is located in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province on the southeastern coast.
And the city is known as the Paradise of the World in China.
Thousands of years ago, the West Lake was connected to the sea.
The Qiantang River, not far away from the West Lake, enters the sea in the eastern part of this area.
Sediment deposited by the river eventually blocked the connection between the West Lake and the sea, making it an inland water feature.
Since the 9th century A.D., the beautiful scenery of the West Lake in all seasons has appeared time and again in poems, stories and legends.
It's roughly estimated there are about 630 legends of the West Lake alone.
In 2011 West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou was included on the World Heritage List.
It is visited by and endless steram of international tourists.
Perhaps some of them will add their own stories to West Lake's wealth of literature.

12. A Cow of and Antelope?

Deep in central China's Qinling Mountains, there are some mysterious wild animals in the untraversed area.
Meet takin.
It is perhaps one of the largest mammals on earth that many people have never heard of.
Without using drone, it's impossible to trawve them and got this rare footage.
Local conservationists said that they haven't seen these enigmatic creatures for more than a decade.
These animals live in an inaccessble area at the altitude of 2,500 meters above sea level.
Many people may think that takin is a kind of cow, because they arethick and strong, and adult individuals can even be as high as 2 meters or more.
In fact, takins are not cows.
They are close to the family of goat antelope, with a pair of small horns, and the sound is similar to that of the antelope.
They are alert to the looming appearance of drone, so when the drone approach them, we need to keep a friendly and safe distance with them.
Now it is time for lunch.
Let's hope our takin friend to have a good meal!

13.  Tree Climbing Lesson

The Giant panda.
You might think it's still an endangered species.
But the good news is, populations are on the rise, due to enormous efforts by Chinese conservation programs, using new breeding technology.
By actively guiding adult pandas to mate, more and more panda babies are being born.
But today, there is an even bigger challenge.
Some of the panda cubs from these breeding programs are being reintroduced to the wild, their native home.
The first thing they ahve to learn, is how to climmb trees.
A panda cub is having a lesson in the forest.
He is already one and a half years old.
That's his mother next to him a wild giant panda. 
Mother and son are taken to a safe wild habitat and are set free to make their own way.
The ability of young cubs to survive in the wild is mainly taught by their mothers.
The moist important skill is to climb trees.
Becaues in this forest, they may encounter enimies, such as other bears.
The little panda seems to have no interest in practicing this new skill.
But mother is strict.
She won't allow her son to be distracted
This is about life and death.
Finally our little panda climbs up to the top of a tree.
See how sharp his claws are, and the strength in his limbs.
The mosst important thing he has acquired is great courage, a natural instinct he inherits from his wild panda mother.
Now it's time to rest, after a tiring day.
Who's a big strong boy then.

14. The Longevity Bird

In China, the red-crowned crane is regarded as a very special animal.
According to zoologists, individual wild cranes can live to be 20 to 30 years.
For the Chinese, it is often associated with luck, fidelity and long life.
In eastern china's coastal city of Yanchen red-crowned cranes arrive each winter.
Among China's extensive large bird population, its known for its elegance.
This graceful creature has white feathers, ad red crown on its head, and a beautiful and elegant posture.
Red-crowned cranes are monogamous.
They have strict needs when it comes to their living environment.
They will only breed where the natural habitat is friendly.
Compared with their breeding grounds thousands of miles away to the north, the water here never completely freezes over in winter.
It's full of food.
And they can hide among the reeds.
But this longevity bird, so cherished by the Chines people, is endangered because its natural habitat is fast disappearing, with only about 2000 left in the world.
1000 of them migrate to Yancheng.
And overwintereach year inthe vast wetlands here.
This is the largest group of red-crowned cranes in the world that continues to migrate.
Thanks to local efforts in wetlands protection and scientific measures to better look after this national treasure, the number of the red-crowned cranes is now rising.
The Yancheng wetland has become a paradise for 
red-crowned cranes.
Ensuring the longevity birds enjoy a long life on this planet.

14. A Home Coming Story of Milu Deer

On the coastal wetlands by the Yellow Sea in eastern China. You'll notice a strange-looking deer walking around.
It has a head shaped like a horse, gian antlers like a deer, hooves like a cow, and the tail of a donkey.
These are Milu deer, a species native to China.
But it disappeared from China, for nearly 100 years.
The fact that they have now returned to China is the result of a remarkable century old animal protection collaborationi between two contries.
Archaeological studies have found that the Milu deer were once common in eastern China, but by the nineteenth century their numbers had dropped drastically.
Most of the Milu deer were raised in the Emperor's hunting grounds outside Beijing.
The Europeans who came to China at the time believed the species to be very rare, and many were taken back to Europe.
When the Emperor's hunting grounds were destroyed by a heavy flooding.
The Milu deer were lost, never to be seen in the area again.
Luckily, there were the Milu deer that had been shipped to foreign countries.
A Duke in Britain had given shelter to 18 of these fortunate Milu deer, and they were well taken care of.
By the mid-1980s, the Chinese government hoped the species could be restored in China once again, a suggestion supported by the Duke's descendants.
In 1986, 39 of the Milu deer were flown to China from Britain to their ancestral home in Dafeng County in Jiangsu province.
After two decades, the Milu deer population in China has increased to over 5000, with nearly 1350 roaming in the wild.
Today, there is no longer any fears for their survival in their homeland.

16. The Tidal Bore of Qiantang River

The qiantang River is located in Zhejiang on the southeastern coast of China and flows into the East China Sea.
Every year on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, people gather along its banks expectantly, eager for the arrival of the tide.
The waters of Hanzhou Bay and the Qiantang River meet on the horizon, forming a thin white line.
Hundreds of thousands of tons of water per second the fusion of ocean and river dramatically tumble back towards the land.
The seawall contains the force of 7 tons per square meter.
The waves can reach a maximum of 9 meters, about three stories high and even taller than four of China's famous basketball player, Yao Ming.
The huge tides and waves do little to deter the bold.
People jumped into the powerrful waves as eawrly as the Southern Song Dynasty of China, more than 800 years ago.
The people of the time called them the Tide Players.
It looks so much like today's surfing, minus the suf board.
It looks so much like today's surfing, minus the surf board.
Today, the Qiantang River attracts thousands of people from far and wide for the annual tidal surfing competition.

17. The Unfrozen River

In Winter, Arxan, a city in northern China becomes a world of ice.
Its rivers become frozen All except me. 
Upstream of the Khalkhyn Gol River, there is a stretch around 20 kilometres long.
Even in winter, when the air temp;erature typically drops to minus 40 to 30 degrees celsius, this section remains ice free.
People call it the unfrozen river.
Its secret lies deep beneath the river bed, where the river passes over an area of geothermal activity near Arxan.
The heat from below, raises the temperature allowing the river water to stay above freezing point and so it remains ice free.
During the harsh winter, it even becomes a spa for animals.
A group of cattle are strolling along the river bank.
They can't wait to wade through the water.
Look closely and you'll see steam rising from the surface of the river Such a nice warm bath!
Let's leave the cattle to enjoy it.

18.  The Road Under the Water

In southern China, there is a famous road built across Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake.
The people of China call it "the most beautiful road under the water."
Towards the end of May every year, this road begins to attract a lot of attention.
The color of the lake either side begins to change into two different tones.
The surface of the road is so close to the water level of the lake.
As you drive along the view ahead is broad and bright.
It feels as though you are riding a boat across the lake.
People call it the road under the water.
For the next few months, this road is no longer just above the surface, but deep under the  water.
As the water level of Poyang Lake rises, the road is gradually flooded.
Although drivers can no longer see the road surface, they can still drive across safely by keeping within the guard rails on either side.
For thrill seeking motorists, it's like driving an amphibious supercar.
As the water levels continue to rise. after a few days the entire road will completely submerged.
Eventually, a few months later, the road reappears again.

19. Ice Flower

During the winter in China's Heilongjiang province, it is not uncommon to see temperatures below minus 30 degrees celsius.
Despite the intense cold, 'flowers' still find a way to bloom.
In the right place, with the right conditions, these flowers spread across the tops of the trees.
Every year, Kurbin enjoys a "flower season" of up to four months.
This amazing ice flower spectacle can be experienced from december to march each year.
Ice flowers ar e offcially known as "rime".
In extremely cold weather, the nearby hydropower station continuously discharges hot water.
The water vapor evaporates from the surface the water, forming a dreamy drifting white mist.
Much of the water vapor turns into ice at night as temperatures drop, which then settles on the tree branches, creating this fantastical sight.
As you walk beneath the trees covered with rime sometimes you can hear the sound of the ice crystals growing and then  falling.
The rime absorbs all sounds around, creating a tranquil fairy tale world.

20. Anjihai Grand Canyon

In Xinjiang, China, the beautiful scenery can often take miraculous forms.
Anjihai Town has become famous the world over due to one canyon in particular.
The river, which originates in the Tianshan Mountains, sushes down on the steep slopes, carving its way through escarpments formed over millenia.
The canyon is about 30 kilometers in length, with the valley floor being 3 to 4 hundred meters at its widest, while the narrowest part is only two or three meters.
From above, Anjihai Grand Canyon is rich in colors.
On either side of the canyon, red sandstone and gray mudstone alternate to create an astonishing landscape.
The colors are formed as the river erodes and dissovles the sandstone and mudstone, drawing abstract pictures on the land.
It is one of the most beautiful and yet virtually unknown canyons in Xinjiang.
Because its is so hidden and the land on either side of the canyon are the saame height, people sometimes comev across it without warning.
It they don't stop in time, then they could easily plunge off the cliff.

21. Mountains in the River

In ancient times, Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, in Eastern China, was called JinKou.
Located at the golden cross of the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, it is a place of strategic importance.
The upper reaches of the Yangtze River deposit a lot of sit here, which has gradually built up into a small island in the river.
There are three beautiful mountains here, namely, Jinshan Mountain, Beigu Mountain, and Jiaoshan Montain, which are closely connected with the Yangtze River and are called the Three Mountains in Jingkou.
Jinshan Mountain is only 42 meters above sea level. 
Although Jinshan MOuntain is said to be on the Yangtze River, because the river's course has moved to the noth, Jinshan is now some distance away from the Yangtze.
Beigu Mountain, 10 meters higher than Mountain, is just beside the Yangtze River. From here, Jinshan Mountain can be seen in the west and Jiaoshan Mountain in the east.
The mighty river flows around the foot of the mountain. Jiaoshan, the highest of the three, with an altitude of 70.7 meters and an area of 38 hectares.
It is located in the Yangtze River, surrounded by water.
Encircled by the green waves, the green mountain looks like a piece of jade floating on the river.
People can reach the island by boat to experience the gentle river water in the dry season, and appreciate the magnificent scene in the wet season.
Compared with many famous mountains, this seemingly inconspicious local landscape composed of three beautiful mountains coexist and integrate with the Yangtze River, becoming a landmark in this area.

22. Flaming Mountain and Grape Valley

Areas around the latitude of 42 degrees noth on earth are mostly known for the cool and pleasant climate.
But there is one exception, which is famous for its incredible heat.
This is the "Flaming Mountain" in China's northwestern Xingjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
Of course, its not really "burning". The mountain is barren and rd, with a blackish tint.
In summer, ground temperature can be as high as 70 degree celsius. People are tricked by their senses into seeing "flames".
It is located at the low point of the Turpan Basin which is also the lowest point of the hinese mainland.
The height difference between it and the surrounding mountains is more than 5000 meters, so the hot air in the basin can not easily disperse.
As a result, the Flaming Mountain becomes the hottest place on its latitude. There is no grass on the Flaming Mountain, but the canyon nearby is shaded by grapes.
The canyon is only 8 kilometers long from north to south, but its annual output of grapes can reach more than 10 million kg.
Almost every family here grows grapes.
After harvest, they are sent to shade houses for drying. The shade houses are built on the slopes of barren mountains, high up and with no shelter, so as to make full use of the hot dry winds i the Turpan Basin.
There are many holes in the walls of the shade houses which not only help with ventilation, but also help avoid diret sunlight on grapes.
It takes just 40 days for the fresh grapes to be dried by the hot air.

23. The Perfect Stopper for Migratory Birds

The Yangzte, China's longest river, rising from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, flows eastwards for 6300 kilometers, eventually reaching Yuantuojiao, in Jiangsu Province in eastern China, where it flows into the sea.
A large amount of sediment carried by the Yangtze river has been deposited here due to the tides.
Gradually, the sandbar is becoming a growing and extending beach plain.
It has also become a popular sopover for a large number of migratory birds.
In the Yanzte River Delta to the north of Yuantuojiao, abundant rivers carry huge amount of sediment to the sea.
They also bring nutrients, piling up to form fertile coastlines and unique sandy ridges and sandbars.
Around the coastline of the Yellow Sea in China, hundreds of kilometers of coastal wetlands and zones have formed.
Every Spring and Autumn, nearly 3 million migratory birds around the world stop here to replenish themselves.
The Yangtze River Delta next to the Yellow Sea, is one of China's most economically developed and densely populated regions.
While the economy is developing rapidly, a large number of coastal wetlands have been preserved.
This creates valuable habitats for millions of migratory birds and endangered species that prefer not to be disturbed.
Today, sediment accumulation and continental shelf settlement are two dynamic geologic forces which are constantly shaping the landscape and ecological processes of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Wetlands, making it one of the most diverse and richest coastlines in the world.
It is an organic combination of natural, biological and human functions, and a key hub on the East Asian-Australasian flyway of migratory birds.

24. He Hometown of Red Pine Tree

In the northeast of China, a dense forest grows in the low mountains and hills, known as the Xiaoxing'an Mountains.
People call it the homtown of the red pine tree.
The Xiaoxing'an Mountains cover a vast area and have a long geological history of about 600 million years.
Trilobite and dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in many places.
Archaeological research show that it was originally and ocean, and formed by sea and land changes over hunrds of millions of years.
When it comes the the Xiaoxing'an Mountains, we have to mention the redpine tree.
Its pine nuts are edible and can be used to make oil.
Its wood is light, soft , delicate and rot-resistent.
However, its economic value is far less than its ecological value.
Every hectare of the red pine forest can absorb 13 tons of carbon dioxide and emit 9.5 tons of oxygen every year.
It can also fix the soil and prevent soil erosion.
Wild animals such as black bears, wild boars and squirrels in the forest often eat the pine nuts.
Squirrels like to store their pin nuts in different plaes as they prepare for the winter.
But they have poor memory and often forget where they have put these nuts.
These forgotten pine nuts sprout in the spring, helping the red pine tree expand its territory
In addition to the red pine tree, there are many different kinds of trees in the Xiaoxing'an Mountains.
Everu autumn, these trees display the beautiful colors of nature.

25. The Most Loyal Partner in the Desert

Badain Jaran Desert, is located in northern China's Inner Mongolia.
Mountains are formed through sand accumulation.
The winds keep blowing the fine sand away, continually eroding them.
Although only about 500 metershigher than the land around, it's enough to merit the title 'The highest sand mountain in the world'.
The desert environment keeps most creatures away but it is a perfect home for camels.
After thousands of years of evolution, they are not only resistant to hunger nad thirst, but also to high temperature nad cold.
In desert storms, they can even walk with their eyes closed.
China is one of the main habitats for Bactrian camels in the world, but the ancestral home of camels is in North America, far away.
Millions of years ago, they migrated all the way across the Bering Strait into Eurasia and started to settle and thrive in their new home.
About 4,000 years ago, Bactiran camels were domesticated.
Since then, becoming mankind's most loyal partners in the desert.

26. Sinkholes and Floor Drains in the Magnetic Mountains

	In southwest China, there is a rift zone with a length of more than 300 kilometers and a width of tens of hundreds of kilometers, which is called the Panxi Rift Valley.
	With untouched forests, moutains, sinkholes and floor drains and other geological wonders, this place is known as the "natural geological museum".
	And the most amazing thing is the mountains are magnetic.
	It is said that an ancient Silk Road once crossed the Panxi Rift Valley.
	At that time, when some peddlers of pig-iron passed through the mountains in Panxi, they occasionally reported that the load was getting much heavier, and found it harder to walk.
	After leaving the area, they sudeenly felt relaxed again.
	What they didn't know at the time was they passed by a succession of magnet mines.
	Even more secrets are hidden on the western edge of the Panxi Rift Valley, where there's a place called Gesala.
	According to a popular local legend, Gesala was built by fairies fro m heaven, and it is the nearest place to the sun.
	Due to erosion and large fractures the unique karst loandform of Gesala has been created.
	Within tens of sqaure Kilometers, there are more than 600 sinkholes and floor drains, a huge underground river, and rolling mountain meadows, which combine to form a primitive and beautiful natural scenery.
	It is also a beautiful paradise where people live in harmony with nature.

27. Yardang Kingdom Sculpted by the Wind
In Gansu Provicne in Northwest China, there are more than 5,000 mounds on the desolate Gobi Desert.
Such a landform is called a Yardang.
Walking through the area , you can hear the eerie howling winds.
They've not only given this place the name "The  Place of Devils", but also carve the Yardang landform into different shapes.
Wind speeds her ecan reach up to Force 12.
Sometimes as fast as the running speed of a cheetah, the fastest animal on land, and strong enough to lift a 10 meter high wave.
These mounds, which were originally sediment layers at the bottom of the lake, are not strong enough to withstand the insistent winds.
The sand and stones picked up by the wind are like weapons, hacking away the rock surface and carving out a variety of shapes, giving full play to the imagination.
A bird's-eye view reveals a regular layout of the mounds.
They ar eall the same height and direction, and look like a great fleet sailing across the Gobi Desert.

28. The Black-necked Crane on the Lakeside of the Plateau
This lake is called Gahai.
It's located about 3,500 meters above sea level in Gansu Province, northwestern China.
People call it the "Pearl on the Plateau".
This is the home to a species of elegant cranes.
The surface area of the Gahai Lake is only about 27 square kilometers.
But it attracts more than 20,000 birds to live and transit every year.
The black-necked crane gets its name from its slender black neck.
They mainly live in  freshwater wetlands on plateaus with an altitude of 2,500 to 5,000 meters.
This is the only crane in the world that grows and breeds on plateaus.
The plateau climate is cold and try.
Black-necked Cranes face a huge chllenge from birth.
But the Gahai Lake nourishes beautiful plants, providing a paradise for the black-necked crane.
One tenth of the world's black-necked cranes spend their summer in the Gahai Lake Wetland.
After this family of four have enjoyed a hearty meal, they take a leisurely stroll along the grassy shore.

29. The Sapphire on the Mountain
Sayram Lake is located in the northern part of Tianshan Mountains in western China.
The gem-like pure blue is the most outstanding feature of this mountain lake.
Often, a boundary can be seen on the lake between different shades of blue.
The secret to this spectacle can be found in the lake water which is rich in minerals.
The amount of mineral deposits varies in different parts of the lake basin showing as different coulours in the refracted sunlight.
The beautiful scenery of the Sayram Lake stems from an abundant water source.
Warm moist airstreams from the Atlantic Ocean reach here from thousands of miles away.
Blocked by mountains and uplifted by terrain, they get trapped, and the resulting rains replenish Sayram Lake.
It's become known as "The Atlantic's last Tear Drop".
In fact, it's the dozens of glaciers around the Sayram Lake that are the reawl creators of the beautiful scenery.
Rivers formed by melting water provide a continous source of freshwater, helping to form a large wetland by the lake.
Lush waterweeds attract swans and other rare birds.

30. The Colorful Pool Group under mOunta Gongga
located in southwestern China, offer some of the most magnificent scenery in the country.
The main peak is called Mounta Gongga.
On the west slpe of the mountain, at an altitude of about 4,000 meters, there is a large calcification pool group, locally called Quanhuatan.
This group of valcification pool under Mounta Gangga is hidden is a valley surrounded by mountains on three sides.
large tracts of white calcified soil have tumbled down from neawrby hill, extending to the bottom of the valley and creating a colorful calcified pool.
At 4,300 meters above sea level, there is a hot spring spouting 1.5 meters high, and the water temperature is always around 30 degrees.
It is the main source of water for Yulongxi Quanhuatan.
More than 900 meters long and 100 meters wide, the Quanhuatan has 8 Quanhua terraces down the mountain.
There are more than a dozen colorful pools of different sizes and shapes on each terrace.
The various aquatic plants and hynobius salamanders in the colorful pond bring endless vitality to this ancient geological wonder.
And the algae of varous colors at the bottom of the pond makes the pool water even more colorful.

31. Chinese Painting on the Coastline
Fujian, located on the southeast coastal area China, has the longest and most tortuous coastline in the country.
3,752 kilometers in length and 1:7.01 bin a tortuosity rate, it is endowed with a wealth of natural bays, mudflats, and includes 1,321 islands.
Rivers flow into the sea in almost every single bay along the coast of Fujian.
These bays are rich in nutients, and the wateer temperature is steady and moderate, making them perfect places for mariculture cultivating marine organisms for food.
About 5,000 years ago in the neolithic Age, the people who lived in this area had already begun farming the seas.
Xiapu County is in the northeast of Fujian Province and has a coastline of 404 kilometers, the longest in the province as a whole and enjoys a subtropical marine climate due to its location.
It has a broad sea area with deep water, a long coastline and rich marine fishery resources, which has created favorable conditions for the booming local mariculture industry.
The mudflats here have witnessed tens of millions of years of history and experienced countless tides rising and falling, forming a unique ecological landscape. 
The mudflats always present different  features and unique local characteristics in the different seasons.
Xiapu's name perhaps explains its uniqueness. Xia means the sky with Pu meaning the sea.
It suggests a dialogue between the two which plays out along its beautiful beaches.
At dusk, the Fishermen of Xiapu County begin to spread the fishing nets on the mudflats.
The shimmering blues are captivating almost like a Chinese painting.
This is not only a natural fishing ground, and home to many fishermen, but also a paradise for photographers.

32. Museum of Marine Erosion Landforms
Pingtan Island is located off the southeast coast of China.
The erosion of the land by the action of the sea has formed various kinds of rock formations.
Pingtan Island is known as the "Musem of Marine Erosion Landforms" because of the rich variety iof formations here.
This Fairyland Scene of the East China sea is typical of marine erosion landforms in the area.
This naturally formed shaft has a diameter of nearly 50 meters and a depth of 40 meters.
Alongside the shaft, there is a huge canon, which looks like a mountain split in two.
Pingtan Island is a world of stones.
On the island there are many strange rock formations, among which the most famous are the Banyang Stone Sail and the God of Haitan.
They are also known as the Double Wonders of Pintan Island.
The Banyang Stone Sail is the world's largest granite spherical weathered marine erosion column.
The reef looks like a big ship, with the two massive boulders as its double sails.
There are many marine erosion landforms on the island, such as the Nanzhai Stone Forest group with its variety of differrent shapes, unpredictable marine erosion caves, and scattered marine erosion platforms and terraces.
They are unique landscapes shaped by the magical power of nature.
33. A Huge Gathering of Migrants Birds
Every spring around mid March, hundreds of thousands of birds arive at the Jingxin Wetland of northeast China's Jilin Province.
It turns this remote area into a fascinating paradise for these migrant birds.
The Jingxin Wetland is located onthe borderof China, Russia and North Korea.
The diverse environment and humid climate make it an important stop-over for migrating birds.
Seagulls are common here because it is very close to the Sea of Japan.
These birds begin their jouney back north after winter, and this is the last stop before leaving China.
Here, they rest and feed.
Many large predatory birds, such as golden eagles, while-tailed sea eagles and Steller's sea eagles are frequent visitors.
They are rare and endangered species in the world and are listed protected animals at a national level in China.
Among these species, the Steller's sea eagles are especially rate, with only a few thousand remainning in the world.
Now, more and more rare birds such as Chinese mergansers and red-crowned cranes are being found in the Jingxin Wetland, attracting hundreds of photographers.
So as not to disturb the birds, the photographers wait quietly in the specified location. They wait patiently among the gathering of birds, for the right moment to capture and amazing moment in nature.
34. The Most Beautiful cherry Valley
Taihu Lake is located in the south of the Yangtze River Delta. Among the numerous lakes on the north of the Yangtze River, Taihu Lake is the largest.
Here, there is a lake island famous for its cherry blossoms.
Yuantouzhu is a peninsula extending into Taihu Lake.
It is named after a giant stone that emerges from the lake and looks for all the world like a turtle with its head held high.
There are more than 30,000 cherry trees and more than 100 varieties planted in Yuantouzhu.
From mid-March to mid-April every year, it is the best time to enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms.
Pink clouds of cherry blossoms cover the trees complemented by the rippling water and flurries of falling cherry flowers.
The history of cherry planting in Yuantouzhu can be traced back to the 1930s.
The cherry blossoms on either side of Changchun Bridge were planted at that time.
In March 1988, more than 400 Japanese friends came to Yuantouzhu and planted 1,500 cherry trees with the citizens of Wuxi.
Since then more than 10,000 Japanese have returned to plant yet more cherry trees.
Yuantouzhu has therefore become a cherry viewing resort in China, attracting countless tourists to enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms here every year.

35. Mysterious Kanas Lake
In China's northwestern Xinjiang, there are many different landscapes and remarkable vviews.
Deep in its northern dense forest, there is an amazingly beautiful lake.
The color of the lake changes with the seasons, light, and temperature difference between morning and evening.
The Kanas Lake, the second largest deep-water lake in China, has a water depth of 190 meters.
Perhaps it's the fear of what lies below the surface that has stirred up legends of a lake monster.
Since the late 190's there have been numerous sightings of the creature in the lake.
It is said that horses drinking by the lake were once dragged into the water by the monster.
Many tourists come all the way to the Kanas Lake, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious marine creature.
Most scientists believe the so-called water monster is a Hucho Bleeker living deep below the surface.
Some of these freshwater salmon can grow to nearly two meters long.
They can be ferocious and secretive, but occasionally merge from the water and make waves.
The warm and humid Atlantic air currents travel over 6,900 kilometers of land into the Altay Mountains, and bring more than 600 mm of precipitation every year, nurturing the largest Siberian taiga forest in China.
Taiga forests have a simple structure, and are mostly composed of tall and straight fir and pine trees.
They grow and multiply by the Kanas Laek, carrying their life on from generation to generation.

36. Maqu Wetland from the Above
In the south of China's Gansu Province, the Maqu Wetland has more than 300 tributaries, large and small, distributed like apillaries across the surface of the earth.
As the Yellow River, China's second longest river, reaches Maqu, the water it carries accounts for just 20% of the total water volume of the Yellow River.
That total swells to 65% as it leaves Maqu.
The abundant water nourishes the vast grassland.
This grassland is located in the eastern end of the Qinghaid-Tibet Plateau in China.
With a total area of 3,750 square kilometers, it is about the size of three city's size of Los Angeles.
But this is no City of Angels, but a paradise for cattle and sheep.
The Oula sheep breed is unique to Maqu.
It gets its name from Mount Oula nearby.
Their slightly spiral upturned V-shaped horns make them handsome beasts.
The secret of the resilience of the Oula sheep lies in the green grassland.
More than 50% of the grassland here is put over to growing Chinese herbal medicines.
By grazing on these herbs, the sheep develop a stronger resistantce to diseases.
Beyond grazing and drinking, running becomes their daily essential fitness sport.
But the Oula sheep are not alone.
The Yaks of Maqu also love running across the wetland grassland.
China is the home of yaks.
More than 90% of yeaks in the worls live on the Qinghai-Tibet Platueau and in the surrmounding siz provinces.
Yaks account for more than half of the livestock raised by Maqu herdsmen.
The rich water and grass not only nurtures Oula sheep a d yaks, but also serves as the cornerstone of the existence of the Maqu people.
The Yellow River, which nourishes more than 750,000 square kilometers of land, is called the "Mother River" by the Chinese people.
The Maqu Wetland contributes nearly half of the water to the yellow River.
What it truly nurtures goes far beyond what we cane see here.

37. The Sea of Flowers on Swamps
In eastern China, there is a sea of flowers blooming in the water.
Every Spring, this gorgeous sea of flowers will attracts countless hourists to appreciate the beautiful scenery.
What poeple are seeing is in fact a great example of Chinese intelligence.
China's ancient philosophy, the harmonious interaction with nature, blooms and bears fruit here.
5000 years ago, this was a beach.
3000 years ago, the coastline moved eastward, and appeared in Xinghua area.
1000 years ago, to prevent floods, the hardworking and intelligent people in Xinghua excavated a networkd of deep ditches or streams in the swamps, and piled up the soil on one side, forming fields suitable for cultivation.
This fields, either square or round, wide or narrow, high or low, long or short, have different shapes and sizes.
Big ones can be a kilometer wide, while the smaller ones just a few meters.
They all have one thing in common, and that is, they are surrounded by water.
The fields are not connected to each other, and look like islets on the sea.
Taking into account the local natural conditions, hardworking and intelligent local ancestors transformed low-lying wetlands unsuitable for agriculture into farmland and fields, providing grans and vegetables for the local people.
But also, these fields have maintained the original water currents, as well as rivers and canals, and the surrounding natural ecological environment.
It has formed a new landscape representing the unity of man and nature.
Today, the unique landform of the Xinghua Fields has become a globally important agricultural heritage. 
Every spring, shen oil seed rape flowers are in full bloom, as people meander between these fields in small boats.
They say, the "boats walk in the water and people swim in the flowers.

39. Guardian of the Desert: Populus Euphratica

Populus Euphratica is the only tree species to be found in the desert of North China.
In Ejina in the west of Inner Mongolia, there's a Populus Euphratica.
As the oldest tree in this Populus Euphratica forest, it's been guarding this place for more than 800 years.
The locals call it the "sacred tree".
Dinosaurs died out about 65 million years ago.
Then a new species appeared along the ancient Mediterranean Sea.
That's the Populus Euphratica.
Seasonally flooded river beds in the Gobi desert are perfect for the Populus Euphratica.
Where there is water, the Populus Ehphratica grows.
Populus Euphratica loves water, but it also highly resistant to drought.
As long as the groundwater is at least 4 meters below, Populus Euphratica can live comfortably.
If the groundwater level drops below 9 meters, it will die.
Because the course of desert rivers changes frequently, Populus Ehphratica has left its mark across the desert.
It acts as a good windbreak, prevents sand erosioni, and is salt resistant.
An adult Populus Euphratica can discharge tens of kilograms of salt and alkali every year.
When the wind is blocked, the sand is fixed, and the soil is improved.
So the ecological environment of Ejina is protected.
To the south of the Populus Euphratica forest in Ejina, lies Badain Jaran, the third largest desert in China.
Without this 360 square kilometers Populus Euphratica forest, the Badain jaran Desert, already 49,200 square kilometers in size, would spread northwar, squeezing the living space of humans.
These Populus euphratica trees form a golden natural barrier, guarding the ecology of Ejina year after year, for another 800 years.

40. A Wet  Island Surrounded by Deserts

The Qilian Mountains, across China's Gansu and Qinghai provinces, stretch for about 800 kilometers from east to west it's a huge mountain range composed of many parallel mountains.
About one third of the peaks of the Qilian Mountains are more than 4,000 meters above the sea.
There are more than 3,000 glaciers storing tens of billions of cubic meters of water in solid form.
If all the glaciers were to melt, the water generated would be enough for a city of 20 million people to use for about 30 years.
However, this mountain system in Northwest China is an island surrounded by drought.
The Qilian Mountains are bounded by deserts on three sides.
To the east is the Loess Plateau with little rainfall.
The glaciers in the mountains determine the fate of this area.
Each time the weather gets warmer, the melted ice and snow of the Qilian Mountains, brings  life to the deserts of Northwest China.
In the north of Qilian Mountains, along the mountain range from east to west , melt-water from the ice and snow nourishes a narrow area of about 1,300 kilometers.
This region, known as the hexi Corridor , is an important part of the ancient Silk Road For thousands of years, Asian and European civilizations have converged and collided here.
The Qilian Mountains still store 80% of the water in this land, continuously nourishing abourt 5 million people and 700,000 hectares of cultivated land.

41. The Story of Water and Stone

Yingxi Peak Forest is located in southern China's Guangdong Province.
With more than 1,000 peaks, the forest stretches for more than 20 kilometers across the flat land.
These small peaks rising from the ground are the result of hundreds of millions of years of water erosion.
This kind of landform is called Karst.
Some 200 million years ago, there was a vast ocean here.
In these seemingly hard rocks, a large number of bones and minerals of marine organisms have been found.
Among them, calcium carbonate washed away by continuously running water.
The shape of the rocks changed as a result.
Hundreds of millions of years of rain erosion has not only carved out peaks, but also scoured out caves underground.
The minerals dissolved in the water were deposited here, turning the caves into great halls full of grand columns.
The continuous flow of water caused some of these caves to collapse, and the Karst contributed a new geomorphic type-sinkholes.
This may appear to us as an eye.
But it is a sinkhole.
The battle between water and rock has crafted Yingxi Peak Forest into a fantastic landscape.

42. A Secret Fairyland

This is one of the most beautiful high ways in China.
It passes through thousands of islands in the West Sea of Lushan Mountain in Jiangxi Province.
There are more than 1,600 islands in this area of water, creating a "lake of a thousand islands".
The lake is vast and tranquik, with an average depth of 45 meters.
On a good day, the visibility in the lake can reach up to 11 meters.
60 kilometers to the northeast of the West Sea, there's a mountainous area.
This is the famous Lushan Mountain.
Lushan Mountain is not one single mountain, but rather a large upland area consisting of 90 continuous peaks, in which the highest one is 1,474  meters above sea level.
Over tens of thousands of years, tectonic movements, glacier erosion, flowing water and other geological processes have created the diverse landscapes of Lushan Mountain.
Running to the north of Lushan Mountain is the yangtze, the longest river China.
The intense humidity endows Lushan with abundant water resources.
There are 22 waterfalls within the mountain.
Lushan Mountain is shrouded in  mist for nearly 200 days of the year.
The average temperature here is 5-6 degrees Celsius lower than that in the plains at the same latitude.
It has been a famous summer resort since ancient times.
There's a "City in the Clouds" some 1,100 meters above sea level in the mountains.
More than 100 years ago, a missionary from the UK built villas here.
The average temperature in summer is only 22 degree Celsius, so it's named Kuling, name which comes from the English "cooling".
Today, these ancient villas are still serving tourists who come here to spend the summer.

43. The louts Terraces

Every summer, in Southeast China's Fujian Province, the Lianhai Terraces in Jianning become one of the most beautiful places in China to appreciate flowers.
In early summer, lotus leaves on the terraces are eager to emerge from the water, and unfurl their beauty.
Jianning County is located in the middle section of Wuyi Mountain.
The high terrain with its unique microclimate is perfect for growing high-quality lotuses.
Lutuses have been planted here for thousands of years.
The Lotuses of Jianning are known as "the Best Lotus" and are listed as a tribute treasure.
There are about 3,300 hectares of lotus flowers here, which produces more than 4,000 tons of seeds every year.
In July, the lotus blossom season, the layers of lotus fields become shrouded in mist, creating an enchanted landscape.
July and August is the peak period for lotus seeds.
The temperature difference between day and night can reach more than 53 degree Fahrenheit, which provides excellent conditions for accumulation of nutrients in the lotus seeds and encourages their expansion and plumpness.
The lutuses of Jianning are mostly cultivted in paddy fields in the mountains.
The mountain spring water flows down, bringing trace elements to the soil, irrigating the lotus fields at the foot of the mountain all the year round.
As a result, the well-nourished lotuses of Jianning have large seedpods, grow well and yield high-quality lotus seeds.
At this time of year, lotus seedpods fill the local markets.
Peel the lotus seeds, and you experience the unique lotus fragrance.

44. Natural Karst Museum

Over time, sand gathers to build strong towers.
But drop by drop, the water washes them clean away.
Imagine hundreds of millions of tons of water dripping for hundreds of millions of years.
How then would the landscape look?
Maybe the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of China is how it would be.
The erosion of soluble rocks by running water has resulted in a variety of karst landforms.
The total karst area in China is 140,000 square kilometers, and Zhijin Cave National Geopark is just one of them.
Zhijin Grand Canyon is a miraculous natural landscape revered by geologists as "a top-class karst landscape".
There are 7 natural bridges on the upper and lower levels, which form a unique masterpiece among geoparks across China.
Corrosion by running water opens a window to a subterranean world.
Zhijin Cave covers an area of more than 700,000 square meters, which is equivalent to 100 football fields.
It takes about 3 hours to tour the whole cave.
The highest part of the cave is 50 stories.
The huge karst deposits, measuring 200 meters in length look like an imposing sculpture or fresco.
Zhijin Cave is endowed with more than 40 types of karst cave deposits and presents a variety of wonders.
The formation of Zhijin Cave has taken at least 2.5  billion years.
Entering the cave is like stepping into a time tunnel.
It feels as though you are no longer on Earth, but rather have stepped into a land of fantasy.

45. The Bubbling Chinese Giant Salamander

In the east of China, near the Yellow Sea in Jiangsu, there's a magical island situated a little way off the province's 765 kilometers of coastline.
Covering an areaw of less than 0.2 square kilometers, Qinshan Island is 1,000 meters long from east to west, and 200 meters in width.
From the air, the island looks for all the world like a giant Chinese salamander, with a huge bulbous head.
Qinshan Island is about 15 kilometers off the coast, and is one of the few coastal islands in Jiangsu Province.
In the past, the island has been ten times its size today.
However, thousands of years of erosion has seen the rock consumed by the sea little by little, eventually spitting out this small fish-like island.
The long tail of this "fish" appears and disappears at regular intervals with the rise and fall of the tides.
It is 2.6 kilometers long and has existed for at least 2,000 years.
The Divine Path of Qinshan Island was formed by the action of the tides against this gravel island.
The shores were gradually worn away and eventually collapsed.
The debris drifted in the currents round to the south side of the island and was gradually deposited under the water line for  a stretch of over 10 kilometers.
The rise and fall of the sea level over time has helped form a mound composed of gravel and debris.
This mound is 2.6 kilometers long and extends from the island towards the land.
Mounds like this can be seen all along the east coast of China.
However, it is very rare for a small island with an area of less than 0.2 square kilometers to have such a feature several times longer and wider than the island itself.
It is known as the longest natural avenue at sea in China.
As the tide retreats, the Divine Path reappears in the sea.
Those who tread this path seem to be walking on an infinity of water.

47. Volcanoes in Wudalianchi Scenic Area

These volcanoes are more than 200 years away from the last eruption.
For volcanoes, more than 200 years is not long at all.
They are young vocanoes in China, but they have witnessed the birth of the Wudalianchi Scenic Area.
Erupting lava spread out in all directions.
Some of it remained here, cooling and solidifying forming a black gray lava plateau measuring hundreds of square kilometers wide, commonly known as the Rock Field.
More lava flowed along the terrain, blocking the path of the river below, eventually forming five beaded lakes.
The lakes are interconnected, hence they are known as the "Wudalianchi", namely, Five Connected Lakes.
With 14 volcanoes nearby, Wudalianchi with its concentration of typical vocanic landforms, is a giant natural vocano museum.
After hundreds of years, human beings, birds and animals, and vegetationi have together reshaped the appearance of this land.
South Globe Mountain has become the symbol of Wudalianchi, not opinly because it is the oldest of the 14 volcanoes, but also because there is a naturally formed lake at its top.
In winter it is covered with snow.
But in the sun, the volcanic rock beneath is exposed, creating a black-and-white volcanic spectacle.
In the bright sunlight this volcano museum becomes a landscape beyond the imagination.

48. The Village in the Sea of Flowers

Wuyuan is known as one of the Most Beautiful Villages in China, and its most beautiful season every year is in the middle and last ten days of March.
When spring comes, oilseed rape flowers in Wuyuan come into full bloom.
These crops from which oil is extracted, can resist the cold in winter.
The crops are sown in the autumn of the previous year and harvested in the summer of the following year.
Jiangxi Province is a big producer of oilseed rape flowers in China.
The most beautiful oilseed rape flowers are in the "Jiangling" and "Huangling" areas of Wuyuan.
Here, there are layers of golden terraces planted with oilseed rape flowers, which complement the residential buildings, with their typical white walls and black tiles, forming a beautifulj picture.
They are said to be one of " the Ten Most Beautiful Terraces in the World".
The terraces in Jiangling can be long or short, and wide or narrow.
The longest can be tens of meters long, while the short ones only measure three or five meters.
Wide terraces are sometimes ten meters broad, and narrow ones, too narrow for cattle plough.
Large terraces are bigger than basketball courts, and small ones are not enough for an adult to lie down.
The terraces are as high as the mountains of Jiangling.
Standing by the side of the road on the hillside, you can see so many terraces, which stretch out along the ridge of the mountain.

49. A Corridor of Apricot Blossom far from the Sea

This ix Xinjiang, China, in the heart of Eurasia, the furthest of any land from sea on the planet.
With little rain, it is an arid and lifeless place.
However, there is one exception.
With warmer temperatures in April, apricot flowers can't wait to bloom, declaring open the flower season in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.
This wild apricot forests are distributed across the hillsides of the Ili River Valley in Xinjiang.
Their delicate flowers dislike the humid climate of Southern China.
They are resistant to drought and cold and are more suitable for living in the north.
Xinjiang has the largest concentration of apricot trees in China.
The apricot forest before us is the largest and densest privmitive wild fruit forest.
It provides a rare opportunity for local people to domesticate the wild apricot trees and improve their varieties.
Apricot blossoms last only a week from blossoming to withering.
In the flowering season, if you want to capture their beauty, then you must be quick.

50. Mount Emei in the Sea of Clouds

Mount Emei, located in the southwest of Sichuan Province, with its back to Tibet Plateau and standing on the southwest edge of the Sichuan Basin, is and famous attraction in China.
Three million years ago, the main part of Mount Emei rose sharply along a fault line here.
Due to a complex combination of erosion, weathering, and collapse, a massive height difference of more than 2,600 meters was formed between today's mountain top and the Emei Plain.
The Summit of Ten Thousand Buddhas, at an altitude of 3,099 meters, is the highest peak of Mounta Emei.
It has the world's highest and largest metal building complex, and is also a world cultural and natural heritage site.
In a commanding position, the Golden Summit with the biggest concentration of temples and scenic spots on Mount Emei, can be called the largest and highest place of worship of Chinese Buddhism in the world.
Buddha in the world and is at the heart of the Golden Summit on Mount Emei.
The ten heads of the Buddha statue are divided into three layers, each with different expressions, representing the ten mentalities of ordinary people.
Many Chinese people come here to pray for protection of the Buddha.
The Golden Summit is also the perfect location to appreciate the wonderous Mounta Emei 'Sea of Clouds'.
The 72 peaks of Mount Emei are mostly over 2,000 meters above sea level.
In such a ocean of white, the many peaks appear to float in the clouds like islands.
This sea of clouds can surround Mount Emei for more than 330 days a year.
Formed by ever changing patches of mist and fog, they present a unique panorama.
Summer and autumn are the best time to view them At every level, the scene is different.
If you are lucky, it's also possible to see Gongga Mountain, 7,590 meters above sea level, in the distance from the Golden Summit.

51. The Sea of Bamboos

Bamboo has been cultivated and utilized in China for thousands of years at least.
And it is possibly one of the Chinese people most cherished plants.
There is a bamboo forest in Sichuan Province in Southwest China.
Hundreds of millions of bamboos cover 27 mountains and more than 500 peaks.
The Bamboo Sea in Southern Sichuan is the largest natural bamboo forest in the world.
It is said that there are 428 kinds of bamboos here.
Among them, the Nan Bamboo, or phyllostachys pubescens, grows the fastest.
They cover more than 47 thousand square kilometers of the mountain side.
And they are able to grow from shoots to mature bamboo in just 40 days and grow into woods within four years.
Bamboo is the most rare renewable resource inthe mountainous areas.
They are surrounded by cloud all year round.

# 53. Crescent Spring in the Desert

The Singing Sands Mountain is located in Dunhuang in western China.
As you walk through the quicksand or slide down a sand mountain, sometimes you can hear loud noises beneath your feet.
Hence the name "The Singing Sands Mountain".
Nestling between the tall sand dunes, there is a little miracle.
This spring, which looks like a crescent moon, has existed for thousands of years and has never dried up.
The formation and continuous existence of Crescent Spring are all related to its topography.
The flowing water converges here along the terrain and overflows through a porous geological layer to form the Crescent Spring.
Although it's extremely dry here, with the annual evaporation being more than 60 times that of the annual precipitation, the stable water source ensures a sustainable water supply to the spring.
It's all due to the low-lying terrain.
Whenever there's a sandstorm, it forms an upward spiral air flow between the surrounding sand mountains, sending the sand at the foot back to the top of the sand mountain, saving the Crescent Spring from being swallowed by quicksand.
The ancient Silk Road once passed by the Crescent Spring.
And today, it has become a romantic paradise for visitors.
