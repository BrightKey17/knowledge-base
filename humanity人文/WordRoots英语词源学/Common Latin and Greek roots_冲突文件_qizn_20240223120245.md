Knowledge brings more knowledge.
Knowledge is no only cumulative, it grows exponentialy.Those with a rich base of factual knowledge find it easier to lean more- the rich get richer. In addition, factual knowledge enchances cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning. The richer the knowledge base, the more smoothly and effectively these cognitive processes operate.

#### Strategies for building background knowledge

Weave the web of understanding from scratch.
Encourage to make connections to the previous experiences and related knowledge. (Self-build)
Introduce and discuss.(Ë¥πÊõºÂ≠¶‰π†Ê≥ï The Feynman Technique)
