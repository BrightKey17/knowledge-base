英国基督教圣公会内部牛津运动领袖，后改奉天主教。
**John Henry Newman** CO was an English theologian, academic, philosopher, historian, writer, and poet, first as an Anglican priest and later as a Catholic priest and cardinal, who was an important and controversial figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century.

His eloquent books, notably Parochial and Plain Sermons (1834-42), Lectures on the Prophetical Office of the Church (1837), and University Sermons (1843), revived emphasis on the dogmatic authority of the church and urged reforms of the Church of England after the pattern of the original "catholic", or universal, church of the Roman Catholic Church as the true modern development from the original body.
