# Mediator Pattern

## Motivation

In order to have a good object oriented design we have to create lots of classes interacting one with each other. If certain principles are not applied the final framework will end in a total mess where each object relies on many other objects in order to run. In order to avoid tight coupled frameworks, we need a mechanism to facilitate the interaction between objects in a manner in that objects are not aware of the existence of other objects.
